## Affordabee: Low-Cost Open Access Publishing

### About the Affordabee project
Students and early career researchers (ECRs) from resource-poor settings face the challenge of publishing their work due to high Article Processing Charges (APCs). During the [OpenScienceKE hackathon](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon) held on 30th and 31st August 2018, we created the [LowCostOpenAccess](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/LowCostOpenAccess) resource to help students and early career scientists make informed decisions on where to publish at low cost.
During the eLife Innovation Sprint 2020, we seek to expand this resource into a platform that will reduce the APC cost barrier for students and ECRs from resource-poor settings.
